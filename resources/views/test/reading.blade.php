    <p class="font-weight-bold m-0 text-center">MAKING FRIENDS</p>
    <div class=" p-0 d-flex flex-column flex-md-row mt-3">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <p class="p-0 mb-2 text-justify">A. There are new people to meet everywhere - the person who is next to you in a class or
                someone who is in front of you in the lunch line. There are many different ways to start a conversation with
                someone new, but it is always a good idea to smile and make eye contact before you begin. Just say “hello”
                and ask questions like, “Where are you from?”. The answer is always a good topic for conversation.
                You can say, “It’s a very nice day, isn’t it?”. It’s important to keep the conversation light and it’s also
                a good idea to follow a 30/70 pattern during small talk when possible. This is 30% talking and 70%
                listening.</p>
            <p class="p-0 my-2 text-justify">B. The Internet is a great way to get to know people and make friends. It isn’t always
                necessary for friends to have common interests. Some good friends are people who are very different from
                each other! However, it’s easy to spend a lot of time online with someone who you think is a friend and then
                find there’s no chance to meet them because of time and distance.</p>
            <p class="p-0 my-2 text-justify">C. Sports clubs are great places to keep healthy and make friends at the same time. They are
                not just for people who are good at playing a sport - they are for everyone. The important thing is to enjoy
                what you do and have fun. A sports team isn’t the only way to a good social life. If you play a musical
                instrument or sing, there are bands or choirs you can join too.</p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold m-0 text-center">RUBIK CUBE</p>
            <p class="p-0 mb-2 text-justify">Erno Rubik first studied scrupture and then later architecture in Pudapest, where he went on
                to become a teacher of interior design. It was while he was working as a teacher that he began the
                preliminary work on an invention that he called the “Magic Cube”.</p>
            <p class="p-0 my-2 text-justify">Rubik was inspired by geometric puzzles such as the Chinese tangram, a puzzle consisting of
                various triangles, a square and a parallelogram which can be combined to create different shapes and
                figures. However, unlike the tangram, which is two-dimensional, Rubik was more interested in investigating
                how three-dimensional forms, such as the cube, could be moved and combined to produce other forms</p>
            <p class="p-0 my-2 text-justify">His design consisted of a cube made up of layers of individual smaller cubes, and each
                smaller cube could be turned in any direction except diagonally. To ensure that the cubes could move
                independently, without falling apart, Rubik first attempted to join them using elastic bands. However, this
                proved to be impossible, so Rubik then solved the problem by essembling them using a rounded interior</p>
            <p class="p-0 my-2 text-justify">This permitted them to move smoothly and easily. He experimented with different ways of
                making the smaller cubes, but ended up with the simple solution of giving a different colour to each side.
                The object was to twist the layers of small cubes so that each side of the large cube was an identical
                colour.</p>
            <p class="p-0 my-2 text-justify">Rubik took out a patent for the Cube in 1977 and started manufacturing it in the same year.
                The Cube came to the attention of a Hungarian businessman, Tibor Laczi, who then demonstrated it at the
                Nuremberg Toy Fair. When British toy expert Tom Kremer saw it, he thought it was amazing and he persuaded a
                manufacturer, Ideal Toys, to produce one million of them in 1979. Ideal Toys renamed the Cube after the
                toy’s inventor, and in 1980, Rubik’s Cube was shown at toy fairs all over the world. It won that year’s
                prize in Germany for Best Puzzle. Rubik’s Cube is believed to be the world’s best-selling puzzle; since its
                invention, more than 300 million Cubes have been sold worldwide.</p>
